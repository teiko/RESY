RESY is an effort to create a responsive template for the blogging software Serendipity (S9Y)


# Detailed description

RESY is based upon the Responsive Template (RT) by Jonathan Verrecchia, aka Verekia. The goal of RT is to provide a website-template which can be viewed by all sorts of devices -- from standard PC's to Smartphones. Just try the RT demo yourself!

RESY extends the RT not only by adapting the look & feel of S9Y, but also by providing the underlying Stylesheet in LESS-Syntax. With LESS, a Webdesigner is able to create his Stylesheets with less instructions -- hence the name! 
New colorsets are simply added by editing the colorsets.csv file and compiling the updated sets using "make colorsets".


# Usage

To make use of the template within S9Y, simply name the folder "production" to your needs and copy it to your S9Y installation (templates-folder!). You're done!


# Compiling

Please have a look at the Makefile.
