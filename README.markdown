RESY is an effort to create a responsive template for the blogging software Serendipity (S9Y)


# Detailed description

RESY is based upon the Responsive Template (RT) by Jonathan Verrecchia, aka Verekia. The goal of RT is to provide a website-template which can be viewed by all sorts of devices -- from standard PC's to Smartphones. Just try the RT demo yourself!

RESY extends the RT not only by adapting the look & feel of S9Y, but also by providing the underlying Stylesheet in LESS-Syntax. With LESS, a Webdesigner is able to create his Stylesheets with less instructions -- hence the name! 
When using LESS, the colors of the template can easily get modified by editing the file less/style.less; if you are comfortable with the overall layout of the template, you can leave all other files untouched.

This template can be seen live in action at http://www.codeless.at/blog


# Compiling:

Please have a look at the Makefile.


# Notes:

  - The template is not able to display images and other media in responsive way
  - RESY makes use of HTML5 elements but doesn't provide a way to let older browsers know how to handle this (no HTML5 shiv!)

# Thanks

Besides Verekia, who put the code of RT as Public Domain, I want to thank Gatis Tomsons from the ruby-forum and Shannon Nelson from stackoverflow.com for their notes about automatic screenshot creation.
Also, my thanks go to the large group of HTML5Boilerplate (h5bp) developers and to Alexis Sellier for his LESS stylesheet language.
Last but not least a big thank you to the S9Y developers and the testers of this template.
